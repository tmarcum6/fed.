# gRoSS

**gRoSS** is a lightweight, self-hosted RSS feed reader built in Go. No Electron. No Node. No nonsense. Just a single binary, a SQLite database, and your feeds.

## Features

- 🔄 **Auto-polling** — feeds refresh every 15 minutes in the background
- ✅ **Mark articles as read** — per article, right from the feed
- 🗂️ **Per-feed views** — browse articles from a single source
- 🔍 **Unread filter** — focus on what you haven't read yet
- 🪶 **Zero dependencies to run** — single binary + SQLite file
- 🖥️ **Server-rendered HTML** — works in any browser, no JS framework

## Routes

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/` | Homepage — all articles |
| `GET` | `/?unread=true` | Unread articles only |
| `POST` | `/feeds` | Add a new feed |
| `GET` | `/feeds/{id}` | View articles for a feed |
| `POST` | `/articles/{id}/read` | Mark an article as read |

---

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run with verbose output
go test ./... -v

# Check coverage
go test ./... -cover
```

Tests use SQLite's `:memory:` mode — no files created, no cleanup needed.
